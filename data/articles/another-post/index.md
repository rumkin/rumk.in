# Absolutely new post

This is another post with absolutely different content. Well this paragraph should
be long enough to make the line meet both right boundary of the text container. At least
once. But it would be preferable it will make it twice or more times.

Also there should be another paragraph. It should be shorter, probably once or
twice. I _couldn't_ decide.

As an option you can open [initial post](../initial-post).

$$
x = f(\frac{y^2}{2})
$$

## JavaScript

Well this is a JavaScript code.

```js
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

## Go

And this is a Golang code.

```go
import (
  fmt
)

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, World")
}
```

## Conclusion

That's all, folks!
